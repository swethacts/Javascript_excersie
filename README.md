## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the complete package, hit the green button saying "Clone or download", choose the "Download ZIP" option, and you're good to go.

### Q2: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you extensively tried fixing the problem on your own? If you failed at fixing it, please **post a detailled description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help as fast as possible! Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

### Q3: Brackets shows me errors, but my code works. Why is that?

**A:** These are _not_ errors in your code, and you can simply ignore them (they just come from so-called linters that are not correctly set up).

### Q4: You keep mentioning your resources page. Where can I find it?

**A:** It's on my website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰

### Q5: What Brackets and VSCode themes are you using?

**A:** I use the theme "OS X Style | Flat & Dark" in Brackets and "Oceanic Next (dimmed bg)" in VSCode. [Here is the complete setup](editors-setup.md).
